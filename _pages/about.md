Hello, I'm currently a second year student studying Computer Science and Mathematics/Applied Mathematics at Stony Brook University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor Jorge-Mendez Mendez and Professor Yi Liu.  

My general research interests lay in combining Generative Models with Robot Learning, such as using Diffusion Models to assist with Task and Motion planning for continual learning, 3D Moleculuar Learning for drug design using Large Language Models (AI4Science).     

 I plan to pursue a PhD in Computer Science to continue doing AI Research.  
Outside of research, I work as a Resident Assistant and a College of Engineering and Applied Sciences mentor for first-year students.
